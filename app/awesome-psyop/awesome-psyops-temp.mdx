# awesome-psyop

A curated arsenal against influence operations, disinformation, and psychological attacks.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> If you suspect that you are the target of a psyop, remember:  
> You may not always be able to block the signal or change your surroundings.  
> Such operations can trigger intense psychological states — including paranoia, mania, or extreme fear of death.  
>  
> It is **critical** to stay in contact with a psychiatrist.  
> Proper treatment can help manage severe fatigue caused by insomnia and improve emotional stability and situational awareness.

## Protocols

### ⚔️ Death Threat Protocol: Power Projection Mode

When you're targeted with fear-based tactics — especially threats of death, exposure, or "final warnings" — do not absorb the signal. Reflect it. Amplify the opposite.

- **Frame Override (mental switch):**  
  “This threat confirms I’m over the target.”  
  Treat it as an attack vector — not a prophecy. Someone wants submission. Respond with signal dominance.

- **Signal Defense Tactics:**  
  **Posture:** Head up. Back straight. Breath calm. Look like someone who writes history, not reads it.  
  **Language override:** Replace “what if they...” with “they should’ve stopped me when they had the chance.”  
  **Output:** Project unity, confidence, force. No reactivity. No fear speech. No pleading.  

  > “You want me silent. So I speak louder.”  
  > “You want me isolated. So I align with others.”  
  > “You want me scared. So I weaponize clarity.”

- **Threat Reversal:**  
  Fear is not a message. It’s leverage. Take it from them.  
  Show productivity under pressure: publish, build, mobilize.  
  Document everything. Turn observation into exposure.  
  Make it clear — attacks create momentum, not silence.
