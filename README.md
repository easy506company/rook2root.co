Website build with Next.js, Tailwind, and AriaDocs as a starter

## Getting Started

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

Cloudflare automatically deploys every push from the `main` branch.


## workflow

- create your branch (e.g. feature/improving-seo) and work on it

```sh
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b eature/improving-seo
```

- create a PR to main
- merge after approval

- to reuse the same branch for further work

```sh
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
