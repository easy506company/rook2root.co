## Common Techniques

### Branded Keyword Targeting  
Bidding on competitor names or product terms in search ads to appear alongside or above their official listings.

### Visual Mimicry  
Designing ads that closely resemble a competitor’s visual identity or messaging to confuse users and capture clicks.

### Affiliate Interception  
Placing paid ads that reroute affiliate-driven traffic, capturing conversions that would otherwise be attributed to partners.

### URL Masking  
Using similar or misspelled domains in ads to mislead users into engaging with a different brand.

### Funnel Insertion  
Running ads that promise the competitor’s offering but redirect to alternate or comparative landing pages.
