## Execution Methods

### Domain Squatting  
Registering similar or misleading domains to siphon off traffic from the intended brand, often during key launches or campaigns.

### Social Handle Mimicry  
Creating accounts with near-identical names, logos, or messaging to impersonate or confuse audiences.

### SEO Impersonation  
Optimizing content to rank for branded search queries using indirect or comparative language that suggests affiliation.

### Marketplace Impersonation  
Listing products on third-party platforms using brand-adjacent language or packaging to capture misdirected interest.

### Covert Comparisons  
Embedding competitor names or visuals in ads or content in a way that suggests endorsement or association without consent.
