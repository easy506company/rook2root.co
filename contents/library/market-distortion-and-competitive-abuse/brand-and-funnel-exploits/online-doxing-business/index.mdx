## Applied Methods

### Executive Targeting  
Publishing personal details of leadership or key staff to provoke public backlash or incite harassment.

### Internal Leak Amplification  
Distributing confidential documents, emails, or internal chat logs to shape narratives or spark controversy.

### Partner and Client Exposure  
Revealing business relationships to disrupt deals, damage trust, or discourage collaboration with the targeted company.

### Strategic Timing  
Coordinating releases during funding rounds, product launches, or legal proceedings to maximize reputational impact.

### Platform-Based Dissemination  
Using forums, social media, or anonymous hosting platforms to ensure broad distribution and resistance to takedown efforts.
