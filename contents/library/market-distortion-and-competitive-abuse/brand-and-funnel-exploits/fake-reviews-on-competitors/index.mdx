## Deployment Tactics

### Review Bombing  
Coordinated posting of low-star ratings and critical comments across multiple platforms to depress overall review scores.

### Anonymous Allegations  
Using throwaway or pseudonymous accounts to post unverifiable claims about product failure, service issues, or unethical practices.

### Sentiment Manipulation  
Writing emotionally charged reviews that focus on fear, regret, or betrayal to heighten perceived risk of purchase.

### Comparative Undermining  
Framing competitor products negatively by favorably comparing them to a preferred or affiliated alternative.

### Third-Party Outsourcing  
Contracting fake review generation to content farms or click groups to scale volume and maintain plausible deniability.
