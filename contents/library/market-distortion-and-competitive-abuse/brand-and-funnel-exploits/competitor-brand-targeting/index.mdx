## Implementation Tactics

### Paid Search Bidding  
Running ad campaigns that target competitor brand keywords to appear in high-intent search results.

### Comparative Landing Pages  
Creating web pages that directly compare features, pricing, or performance—structured to position the competitor unfavorably.

### Metadata Insertion  
Embedding competitor names in meta titles, descriptions, and alt tags to increase visibility in brand-related searches.

### Content Co-Tagging  
Publishing blog posts or videos tagged with competitor names to rank in shared content ecosystems and siphon interest.

### Retargeting Based on Brand Behavior  
Serving ads to users who engage with competitor brands online by tracking behavioral signals and brand interactions.
