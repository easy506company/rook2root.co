Embedding competitor names in meta titles, descriptions, and alt tags to increase visibility in brand-related searches.

### Content Co-Tagging  
Publishing blog posts or videos tagged with competitor names to rank in shared content ecosystems and siphon interest.

Serving ads to users who engage with competitor brands online by tracking behavioral signals and brand interactions.
