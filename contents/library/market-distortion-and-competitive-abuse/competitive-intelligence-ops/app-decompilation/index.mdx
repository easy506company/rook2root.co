title: App Decompilation
description: The process of reverse engineering mobile applications or software products to extract source code, proprietary algorithms, or other valuable intellectual property—typically to analyze, replicate, or exploit competitors' technology.
metaDescription: Reverse engineering apps to extract source code, algorithms, or IP for analysis, replication, or competitive advantage.

## Common Techniques

### Decompiled Code Analysis  
Extracting and analyzing compiled app files (e.g., APK or IPA) to access source code, logic, or security flaws that could be used to copy or circumvent functionality.

### Resource Extraction  
Isolating and repurposing resources like images, scripts, and assets embedded within the app to gain insights into design or functionality.

### API Discovery  
Identifying and reverse-engineering API endpoints exposed by the app, potentially leading to access to backend systems, features, or user data.

### Security Vulnerability Identification  
Finding weaknesses in the app's code, encryption, or authentication mechanisms that could be exploited for further access or competitive advantage.

### Repackaging and Rebranding  
Modifying and republishing a competitor’s app or its components with minor changes, often to bypass copyright protections or monetize unauthorized versions.
