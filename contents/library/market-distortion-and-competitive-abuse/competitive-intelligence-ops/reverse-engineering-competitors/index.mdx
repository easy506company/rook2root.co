## Common Methods

### Code Dissection  
Analyzing competitor’s software code, APIs, or binaries to understand their architecture, algorithms, and logic, often with the aim of replicating or building upon it.

### Interface and Interaction Analysis  
Studying how competitors' products or services interact with users, identifying design choices, workflows, and features that could be adapted or improved.

### System Architecture Evaluation  
Deconstructing the underlying infrastructure and technology stack to uncover how a competitor’s system scales, handles traffic, or manages data flows.

### Feature Identification  
Extracting key features or hidden functionalities from a competitor’s product to assess its market position and develop comparable offerings or competitive advantages.

### Security and Vulnerability Assessment  
Testing and probing a competitor’s product for security flaws or weaknesses that can be exploited or used to refine one's own security practices.
