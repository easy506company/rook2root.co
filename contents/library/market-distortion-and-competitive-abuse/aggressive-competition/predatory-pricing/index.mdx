## Execution Strategies

### Below-Cost Launches  
Offering core products or services at a sustained loss to rapidly acquire users and pressure rivals to match unsustainable pricing.

### Market Segmentation Tactics  
Targeting competitor strongholds with localized undercutting, while maintaining higher prices in less contested segments.

### Funding-Driven Suppression  
Using investor capital or surplus from other divisions to absorb losses while competitors struggle to remain solvent.

### Lock-In Discounts  
Providing deep, time-limited pricing to onboard customers with long-term retention plans that outlast initial losses.

### Denial of Scale  
Preventing competitors from reaching viable scale by flooding the market with aggressively priced alternatives.
