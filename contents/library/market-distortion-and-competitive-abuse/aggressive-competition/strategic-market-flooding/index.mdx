## Deployment Models

### Product Line Saturation  
Launching multiple similar offerings at various price points to crowd out competitors from key segments.

### Content Volume Domination  
Publishing large volumes of SEO-targeted content, listings, or ads to monopolize digital real estate and suppress organic reach for rivals.

### Feature Fragmentation  
Creating minor variations of a core product to confuse comparisons and reduce perceived value in alternative offerings.

### Channel Overload  
Flooding ad networks, marketplaces, or media platforms with coordinated campaigns to raise acquisition costs for competitors.

### Defensive Releases  
Preemptively launching placeholder products to fill strategic gaps and prevent rivals from establishing footholds.
