## Structural Approaches

### Vertical Integration  
Controlling supply chains, distribution, and customer interfaces to lock out third-party access and reduce competitive surface area.

### Ecosystem Lock-In  
Creating closed ecosystems where switching costs, interoperability barriers, or proprietary standards prevent user migration.

### Market Consolidation  
Acquiring or merging with adjacent players to absorb user bases and eliminate overlapping offerings.

### Cross-Subsidization  
Using profits from dominant segments to undercut competitors in emerging markets, sustaining losses to capture share.

### Data Advantage Exploitation  
Leveraging superior access to market or user data to optimize performance, predict trends, and suppress competitive visibility.
