## Execution Patterns

### Burn-to-Grow Capital Deployment  
Deploying large amounts of funding to acquire users, customers, or market share with little regard for short-term profitability.

### Infrastructure Overload  
Scaling operations, hiring, or infrastructure in anticipation of future demand rather than based on current performance.

### Aggressive Market Entry  
Entering new regions or verticals at speed with minimal localization, legal preparation, or compliance to outpace competitors.

### Loss-Leading Strategy  
Sustaining prices below cost to deter entry or force incumbents to match unsustainable terms.

### Preemptive Fundraising  
Securing large capital rounds early to create funding asymmetry and signal dominance to investors, customers, and competitors.
