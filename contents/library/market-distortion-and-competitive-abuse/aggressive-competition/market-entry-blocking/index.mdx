## Competitive Tactics

### Exclusive Contracts  
Securing long-term agreements with key suppliers, distributors, or platforms to deny access to new entrants.

### Regulatory Gatekeeping  
Influencing policy, licensing, or certification processes to increase compliance burdens for competitors.

### Saturation Tactics  
Rapidly filling market segments with variants, sub-brands, or placeholder products to crowd out competitive positioning.

### IP-Based Deterrence  
Amassing patents or trademarks to create legal uncertainty or threaten litigation against emerging players.

### Dominant Channel Lock-in  
Occupying high-traffic sales, ad, or media channels through bulk buying or early commitments to limit discoverability for others.
