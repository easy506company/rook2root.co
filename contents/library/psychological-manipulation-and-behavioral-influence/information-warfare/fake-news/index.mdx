### Biased Reporting  
Presenting factual information selectively or out of context to create a distorted view of a competitor’s behavior, often in a way that undermines their credibility.

### Manipulated Headlines  
Using sensationalized or misleading headlines to grab attention and misdirect focus, often exaggerating negative aspects of a competitor’s business practices or outcomes.

### Sponsored Disinformation  
Paying influencers, media outlets, or bloggers to distribute false or biased content that aligns with a business agenda, discrediting a competitor or promoting a false narrative.

### Viral Hoaxes
