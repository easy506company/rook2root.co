Coordinating online campaigns to spread specific narratives, mislead audiences, or alter public opinion on business matters, such as product reputation, market positioning, or leadership.

### Data Exploitation  
Acquiring and manipulating competitor data to use it against them, either through leaks, hacks, or the subtle release of partial or misleading information to influence decision-making.

### Reputation Attacks  
Launching covert or overt attacks aimed at damaging the credibility and trustworthiness of a competitor through the spread of false or misleading information, often by leveraging digital platforms.

### Social Media Manipulation  
Using fake accounts, bots, or paid influencers to push specific narratives, flood conversations with misleading messages, or suppress critical discourse, manipulating public perception of a competitor’s brand.
