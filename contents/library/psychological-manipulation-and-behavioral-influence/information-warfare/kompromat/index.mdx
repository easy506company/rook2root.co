## Common Tactics

### Personal Scandals  
Collecting and using private, potentially damaging information about business leaders or employees—such as financial issues, personal indiscretions, or unethical behavior—to pressure or manipulate them.

### Leaked Confidential Information  
Exposing sensitive business documents, internal communications, or strategic plans to damage a competitor’s reputation, disrupt operations, or undermine their credibility.

### Financial or Legal Vulnerabilities  
Exploiting knowledge of a competitor’s legal battles, financial struggles, or unresolved conflicts to destabilize their position and create doubts among investors or partners.

### Covert Surveillance  
Gathering compromising information through surveillance, hacking, or other means to create leverage over competitors or key industry players.

### Coercion through Exposure  
Threatening to release damaging information unless certain demands are met, such as altering business strategies, dropping pricing or market practices, or giving up competitive advantages.
