## Common Methods

### Fabricated Stories  
Creating entirely false narratives and distributing them as factual, often through anonymous or misattributed channels to avoid detection.

### Source Masking  
Disguising the origin of the information, making it appear as though it comes from a neutral or credible source when it is actually planted by interested parties.

### Disinformation Campaigns  
Coordinating the spread of misleading or distorted facts across various media platforms to destabilize or discredit competitors or political opponents.

### Reverse Attribution  
Blaming competitors or adversaries for actions they did not take, often through fake accounts, anonymous posts, or falsified evidence.

### Public Opinion Manipulation  
Influencing public opinion by selectively presenting misleading information to provoke negative reactions or shift perceptions.
