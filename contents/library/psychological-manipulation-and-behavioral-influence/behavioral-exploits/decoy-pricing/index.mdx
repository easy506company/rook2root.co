## Application Strategies

### The Asymmetric Comparison  
Introducing a third, overpriced option that makes the higher-priced target choice seem more reasonable by comparison.

### Price Anchoring  
Setting the decoy at a high price point to make the more expensive option seem like a better deal relative to the decoy's value.

### Choice Framing  
Presenting options where the decoy is clearly not intended for purchase, but instead highlights the perceived value of the other available options.

### Bundle Pricing Manipulation  
Including the decoy option in product bundles to push customers toward more profitable individual purchases or combinations.

### Subscription Tier Decoys  
Offering a middle-tier subscription at a premium to make the most expensive option seem more worthwhile to customers.
