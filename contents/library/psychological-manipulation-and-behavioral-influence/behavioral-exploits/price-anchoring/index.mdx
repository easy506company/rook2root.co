## Common Techniques

### High-Priced Comparisons  
Presenting an initially high price alongside a lower, discounted price, making the discount seem larger and the product more attractive.

### Decoy Product Pricing  
Introducing a high-priced decoy item next to the product you want to sell, making the target product appear as a better deal.

### Bundle Anchoring  
Offering bundled products at a price that makes individual items in the bundle seem like a better value when compared to purchasing them separately.

### Subscription Tier Anchoring  
Presenting a high-tier subscription with many features as a reference, making the middle-tier option seem more reasonable and affordable.

### Cross-Category Comparison  
Positioning products from different categories together (e.g., luxury vs. budget) to create a perceived value difference and nudge customers toward the target product.
