## Common Techniques

### Flash Sales  
Offering deep discounts or special offers for a very short, defined period, pushing customers to act fast to take advantage of the deal.

### Countdown Clocks  
Displaying countdown timers on product pages or checkout areas to visually reinforce the idea that time is running out to make a purchase.

### Last-Minute Deals  
Promoting “last chance” offers or “final hours” deals that make customers feel they will lose the opportunity if they don’t act immediately.

### Stock Limitation Messaging  
Indicating that only a limited number of items are left, often with phrases like “only X left in stock,” to push consumers into a hasty decision.

### Seasonal Urgency  
Using the time of year to create urgency, such as emphasizing that offers or products are only available during certain seasons or holidays.
