## Common Techniques

### Limited-Time Offers  
Promoting products or services as available only for a short period, encouraging immediate action to avoid missing the opportunity.

### Low-Stock Notifications  
Displaying messages indicating that products are running low in stock or that only a few units remain, prompting consumers to purchase before itâ€™s too late.

### Exclusive Access  
Offering special deals or products that are marketed as available only to a select group of customers or for a limited time.

### Countdown Timers  
Using countdowns on landing pages or checkout processes to emphasize the urgency of making a purchase before an offer expires.

### Seasonal Availability  
Releasing products in limited seasonal batches or for certain periods, creating a sense of exclusivity and scarcity tied to specific times of the year.
