## Common Tactics

### Injunction-First Approach  
Filing for immediate injunctions to halt product launches, advertising campaigns, or partnerships during critical windows.

### Reputation Damage  
Leveraging public lawsuits to create uncertainty, reduce investor confidence, or sway customer perception regardless of outcome.

### Discovery Fishing  
Using the legal discovery process to gain access to internal documents, data, or strategy materials under court supervision.

### Cost Pressure  
Sustaining litigation over extended periods to deplete competitor resources, especially targeting smaller or underfunded entities.
