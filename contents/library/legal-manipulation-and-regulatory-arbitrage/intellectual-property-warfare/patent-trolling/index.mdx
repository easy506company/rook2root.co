## Operational Strategies

### Mass Infringement Claims  
Filing lawsuits against multiple companies simultaneously to pressure rapid settlements regardless of merit.

### Forum Shopping  
Filing in jurisdictions with favorable rulings or faster legal timelines to increase leverage in negotiations.

### Portfolio Fragmentation  
Breaking up patent portfolios across entities to create complexity, obscure ownership, or multiply legal risk.

### Preemptive Filings  
Registering broad or vague patents in anticipation of future market developments to block innovation or monetize adoption.
