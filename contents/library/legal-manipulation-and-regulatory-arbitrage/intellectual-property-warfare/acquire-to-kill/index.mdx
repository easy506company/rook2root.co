## Execution Patterns

### Silent Shutdown Post-Acquisition  
Maintaining minimal communication following acquisition before quietly discontinuing the acquired product or service.

### Market Preemption  
Acquiring early-stage or fast-scaling competitors to prevent them from capturing key market segments or investor attention.

### Patent & Talent Absorption  
Targeting companies primarily for their intellectual property or teams, with no intent to continue their product lines.

### Regulatory Delay Usage  
Timing acquisitions to avoid antitrust scrutiny or exploit lag in enforcement during strategic industry rollups.
