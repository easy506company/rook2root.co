## Representative Practices

### Implicit Claims  
Using suggestive language or imagery that implies specific benefits or outcomes without making direct, falsifiable statements.

### Influencer Disclosure Evasion  
Embedding paid promotion in personal content without clear, timely disclosure—exploiting inconsistent enforcement across platforms.

### Native Ad Blurring  
Designing ads to resemble editorial or user-generated content, reducing ad recognition and increasing engagement under unclear labeling standards.

### Conditional Guarantees  
Offering guarantees tied to vague or restrictive conditions, limiting enforceability while increasing perceived security.

### Jurisdictional Drift  
Targeting regions with varying ad regulations through centralized campaigns that exploit leniency or lag in local enforcement.
