## Execution Methods

### Omitted Variables  
Highlighting advantages while excluding relevant context, such as product tiers, pricing terms, or usage conditions.

### Fabricated Benchmarks  
Citing unverifiable or self-conducted studies as authoritative comparisons to establish credibility.

### Visual Framing  
Using charts, imagery, or UI elements that distort scale or outcome to create a false sense of superiority.

### Outdated Comparisons  
Referencing competitor performance, pricing, or features that are no longer current to mislead viewers.

### Fine Print Minimization  
Placing key disclaimers or limitations in small, unreadable text to technically satisfy compliance without informing users.
