## Strategic Models

### Multi-Domicile Structuring  
Incorporating in low-regulation regions while operating in high-restriction markets to avoid direct compliance obligations.

### Licensing Loopholes  
Using umbrella licenses, proxy agents, or passthrough arrangements to offer services in regions without securing full regulatory approval.

### Legal Shielding  
Separating business units across entities or borders to reduce liability exposure and regulatory reach.

### Policy Asymmetry Timing  
Launching or scaling in regions where new regulations are pending but not yet enforced, creating a temporary strategic window.

### Enforcement Gaps  
Targeting countries or industries with known weak enforcement records to reduce risk of audit, penalty, or legal action.
