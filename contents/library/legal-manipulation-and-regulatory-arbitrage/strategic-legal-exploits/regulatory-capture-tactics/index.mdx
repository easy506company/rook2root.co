Sponsoring studies or whitepapers that support preferred regulatory outcomes under the appearance of neutrality.

### Lobbying Through Trade Groups  
Using industry associations to collectively advocate for regulations that entrench incumbents or raise barriers for new entrants.

Providing pre-written regulatory language to lawmakers, ensuring business-friendly terms are embedded in proposed policies.

Establishing joint initiatives with regulatory bodies to gain informal influence over agenda-setting and policy implementation.
