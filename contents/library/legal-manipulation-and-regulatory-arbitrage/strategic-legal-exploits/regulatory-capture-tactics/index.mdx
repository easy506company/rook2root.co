## Influence Mechanisms

### Revolving Door Appointments  
Hiring former regulators or placing industry executives in oversight roles to align policy with business objectives.

### Industry-Funded Research  
Sponsoring studies or whitepapers that support preferred regulatory outcomes under the appearance of neutrality.

### Lobbying Through Trade Groups  
Using industry associations to collectively advocate for regulations that entrench incumbents or raise barriers for new entrants.

### Drafting Model Legislation  
Providing pre-written regulatory language to lawmakers, ensuring business-friendly terms are embedded in proposed policies.

### Soft Power via Partnerships  
Establishing joint initiatives with regulatory bodies to gain informal influence over agenda-setting and policy implementation.
