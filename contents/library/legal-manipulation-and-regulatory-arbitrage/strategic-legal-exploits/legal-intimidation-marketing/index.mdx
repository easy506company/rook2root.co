## Documented Tactics

### Cease-and-Desist as PR  
Publicizing cease-and-desist letters to frame competitors as infringing or unethical, regardless of legal outcome.

### Trademark Aggression  
Issuing broad or speculative trademark claims to block competitor branding, domain names, or ad placements.

### Legal Threat Language in Ads  
Incorporating legal terminology in promotional material (e.g. “illegal copy,” “under investigation”) to instill doubt about competitor legitimacy.

### Contractual Warnings  
Referencing existing agreements or exclusivities in marketing to imply restricted access or future legal action against partners or users.

### Regulatory Name-Dropping  
Alluding to potential regulatory scrutiny of competitors to imply risk without direct accusations.
