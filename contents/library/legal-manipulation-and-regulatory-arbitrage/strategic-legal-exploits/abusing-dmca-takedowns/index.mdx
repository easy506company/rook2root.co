## Deployment Strategies

### Mass Filing Campaigns  
Submitting multiple takedowns across platforms to overwhelm moderation systems and maximize disruption before appeals are processed.

### Pre-Launch Suppression  
Filing claims against upcoming competitor releases to delay launches or create legal uncertainty during critical windows.

### False Attribution  
Claiming ownership of content with weak or fabricated evidence to trigger automated removals without judicial oversight.

### Platform Policy Exploitation  
Targeting platforms with strict takedown compliance procedures, where content is removed immediately without evaluating claim validity.
