## Common Techniques

### Product Disassembly  
Breaking down a competitor's product or service into its core components to analyze the underlying technology, design, and functionality.

### Software Decompilation  
Reversing compiled software code into a readable format to understand the underlying algorithms, architecture, or proprietary processes.

### System Architecture Analysis  
Examining the infrastructure and backend systems used by competitors to understand how their technology is structured, scaled, or integrated.

### Feature Replication  
Identifying key features of a competitor's product and recreating similar features in one's own offering, often improving on or modifying them for competitive advantage.

### Vulnerability Detection  
Testing a competitorâ€™s product or system for weaknesses or security flaws that could be exploited for competitive gain or to inform product development.
