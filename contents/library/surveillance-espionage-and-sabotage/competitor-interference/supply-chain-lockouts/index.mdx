## Common Tactics

### Exclusive Supplier Agreements  
Securing long-term contracts or exclusive arrangements with critical suppliers, preventing competitors from obtaining the same resources or materials.

### Strategic Distribution Blockades  
Using influence or leverage to block or limit a competitor’s access to distribution channels, wholesalers, or retailers, impeding their ability to reach customers.

### Pricing Manipulation  
Coercing suppliers or partners to increase prices or impose unfavorable terms on competitors, forcing them to pay higher costs or take on less favorable contracts.

### Resource Hoarding  
Intentionally stockpiling scarce materials or products to drive up costs or reduce availability, preventing competitors from securing the necessary resources.

### Deliberate Delays  
Intentionally delaying shipments, production, or delivery times to create operational disruptions for competitors who rely on timely supply chain execution.
