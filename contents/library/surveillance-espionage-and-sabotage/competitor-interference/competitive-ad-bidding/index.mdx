## Common Techniques

### Brand Name Bidding  
Targeting competitor brand keywords in search engine ads to capture high-intent traffic from users searching for the competitor's products or services.

### Product-Specific Bidding  
Bidding on keywords tied to a competitor's specific product offerings to redirect potential customers to alternative products or services.

### Price Comparison Ads  
Creating ads that feature competitor products or services alongside pricing or value propositions, encouraging users to click on the alternative offering.

### Sponsored Competitor Terms  
Bidding on common industry terms or product categories where competitors have high visibility, aiming to divert attention or clicks away from their ads.

### Geo-Targeted Bidding  
Using location-based targeting to bid on competitor keywords in specific regions, markets, or areas where the competitor has a strong presence, to reduce their local market visibility.
