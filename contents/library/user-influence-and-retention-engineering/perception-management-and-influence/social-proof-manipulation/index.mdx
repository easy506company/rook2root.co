## Observed Types

### Activity Messages
Pop-ups or notifications claim that others are actively engaging with a product or service, often without verifiable data.

### Exaggerated Metrics
Follower counts, download numbers, or engagement stats are inflated to suggest widespread adoption.

### Simulated Demand Signals
Interfaces simulate user behavior (e.g., “10 people are viewing this now”) to create urgency and desirability.
