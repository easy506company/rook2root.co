## Observed Types

### Hard-to-Find Settings
Critical controls, such as cancellation or privacy settings, are deeply buried or mislabeled.

### Manual Intervention Requirements
Users are forced to contact support, fill out forms, or speak to agents to complete simple requests.

### Non-Functional or Misleading Links
Interface elements suggest functionality (e.g., “Cancel here”) but redirect or fail to work as expected.
