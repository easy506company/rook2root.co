## Confirmshaming
Language is constructed to evoke guilt or shame when opting out of a suggested action.

## Trick Wording
Language is intentionally ambiguous or complex, causing user misinterpretation.

## Visual Interference
Visual design is structured to draw attention away from less desirable options (e.g., muted opt-outs, vibrant CTAs).

## Pressured Selling
Interface defaults or recommendations favor more expensive or bundled options, often under pretense of urgency or value.
