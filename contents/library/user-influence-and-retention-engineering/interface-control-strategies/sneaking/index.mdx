## Sneak into Basket
Additional items are added to the userâ€™s cart without explicit consent, often as pre-selected add-ons.

Extra charges (e.g., fees, taxes, services) are only revealed at the final stages of checkout.

## Hidden Subscription
A recurring billing model is embedded within what is presented as a one-time purchase or free trial.
