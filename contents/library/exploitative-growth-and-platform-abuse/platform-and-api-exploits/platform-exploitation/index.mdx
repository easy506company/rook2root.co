## Operational Tactics

### Abuse of Recommendation Systems  
Gaming algorithms through coordinated activity, artificial signals, or mass content production to dominate visibility.

### Policy Lag Exploitation  
Deploying tactics during periods of weak enforcement, delayed moderation, or evolving rules to achieve temporary advantage.

### Multi-Account Schemes  
Creating and managing large volumes of user accounts to manipulate votes, reviews, referrals, or access quotas.

### Incentive System Manipulation  
Exploiting referral, reward, or partner programs beyond intended limits through automation, simulation, or structural loopholes.

### Content Format Arbitrage  
Packaging content in ways that bypass detection or moderation—e.g., embedding links in media files or using non-standard encodings.
