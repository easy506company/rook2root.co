## Known Vectors

### Dependency Injection  
Introducing malicious code or behavior into widely used software libraries or packages that are unknowingly integrated by competitors.

### Vendor Compromise  
Gaining access to a competitor’s systems by breaching their service providers—such as hosting, analytics, or communication tools.

### Update Path Manipulation  
Exploiting software update mechanisms to deliver altered or backdoored code under the guise of legitimate patches.

### Credential Leakage via Integrations  
Harvesting credentials, tokens, or configuration details exposed through poorly secured third-party integrations.

### Downstream Data Access  
Accessing sensitive data flowing through shared platforms (e.g. CRMs, cloud services) where visibility is assumed but not explicitly controlled.
