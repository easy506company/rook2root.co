## Tactics

### Bypassing Tiered Pricing  
Accessing enterprise-level features via lower-tier or free plans by directly invoking privileged endpoints.

### Competitive Intelligence Harvesting  
Extracting structured data from competitor APIs to map pricing, inventory, or feature sets in real time.

### Automation of Restricted Actions  
Using APIs to automate purchases, reservations, or engagements that are limited or rate-controlled in standard user flows.

### Shadow Integration  
Building unauthorized tools or services on top of another platformâ€™s API to capture users, data, or traffic.

### Undermining Platform Monetization  
Accessing paid content or services through backend APIs, avoiding revenue mechanisms while retaining full functionality.
