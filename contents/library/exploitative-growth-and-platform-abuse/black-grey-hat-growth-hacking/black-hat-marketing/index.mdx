## Common Tactics

### Cloaking  
Serving different content to platforms and users—e.g. search engines see compliant pages while users are redirected to prohibited content.

### Fake Engagement  
Generating fake likes, followers, reviews, or comments to simulate popularity and social proof.

### Click Injection  
Hijacking attribution by injecting fake clicks to claim credit for organic or paid installs.

### Spam Distribution  
Mass-posting links, ads, or fake accounts across forums, comments, or messaging systems to drive traffic or disrupt competitors.

### Malvertising  
Embedding malicious payloads or deceptive links in ads to exploit ad networks or compromise users.
