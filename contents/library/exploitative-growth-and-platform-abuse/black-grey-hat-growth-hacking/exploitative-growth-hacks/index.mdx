### Viral Loops with Imposed Sharing  
Features are locked or gated behind sharing requirements, turning users into acquisition channels to access basic functionality.

### Forced Opt-Ins  
Account creation, newsletter subscriptions, or permissions are embedded into unrelated flows, increasing conversion by minimizing friction or visibility.

### Onboarding Loopholes  
Bypassing standard compliance or moderation checks through alternate signup flows, increasing speed to market or reducing acquisition barriers.

### Hidden Feature Unlocks  
Strategic placement of powerful features behind arbitrary actions, encouraging repetitive use or progression through non-obvious triggers.

### Incentive Gaming  
Using referral, reward, or loyalty systems in ways that amplify reach or retention disproportionately to cost or platform intent.
