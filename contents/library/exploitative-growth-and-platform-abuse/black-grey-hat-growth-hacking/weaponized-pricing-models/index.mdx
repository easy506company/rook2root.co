### Decoy Pricing  
Introducing a mid-tier option to steer users toward a higher-margin choice by framing it as the better value.

### Friction Pricing  
Adding incremental costs or complexity to downgrade, cancel, or switchâ€”encouraging retention through deterrence rather than value.

### Price Discrimination  
Segmenting users by geography, device, or behavior to serve differentiated pricing that maximizes revenue per user.

### Hidden Fees  
Displaying low base prices while deferring full cost disclosure until checkout, increasing likelihood of commitment before objection.

### Free-to-Paid Funnels  
Offering limited free access with rapid transitions to paid tiers, often triggered by basic use or storage thresholds.
