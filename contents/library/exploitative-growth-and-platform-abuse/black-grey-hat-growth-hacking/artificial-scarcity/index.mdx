### Invite-Only Access  
Access is restricted through artificial gating mechanisms, such as “invite-only” systems, implying exclusivity while controlling early user flow.

### Limited-Time Offers (Looped)  
Time-bound deals are repeatedly reintroduced or extended, simulating urgency without reflecting actual scarcity.

### Stock Manipulation  
Inventory levels are manipulated to display false low availability, increasing perceived demand and prompting impulsive decisions.

### Waitlists with Hidden Openings  
Waitlists are presented to simulate high demand, while entry is quietly granted to most or all users after short delays.
