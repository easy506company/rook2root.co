> In 2025, an Austrian privacy non-profit filed complaints accusing e-shops like AliExpress, SHEIN, Temu for violating data protection regulations in the European Union by unlawfully
transferring users’ data to China (Lakshmanan, 2025).
In 2024 the state of Arkansas sued the Chinese online
retailer Temu for illegally accessing user information (Smith, 2024). In 2023, hundreds of online stores
were reported for accidentally leaking customer data
in public folders without any restrictions (Weigand,
2023). In 2019, a study showed that at least 80% of
shopping apps leak users’ data (Langone, 2019). [source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13212)
