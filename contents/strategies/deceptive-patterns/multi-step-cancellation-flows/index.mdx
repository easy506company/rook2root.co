## Overview

Multi-step cancellation flows that are deliberately complex and designed to make it harder for users to cancel a service. Instead of allowing a simple "cancel" button, companies fragment the process across several steps—each requiring new confirmations, justifications, or distractions—with the goal of reducing churn.

## Common Tactics

### Step Fragmentation

- Break cancellation into 3, 4, or more separate pages.
- Each page requests new inputs: *"Reason for leaving,"* *"Would you like a discount instead?"* *"Confirm again."*

### Emotional Disruption

- Insert emotional appeals: *"We’ll miss you!"* or *"Are you sure you want to lose your premium benefits?"*
- Highlight imaginary "losses" or "regrets" to induce FOMO (fear of missing out).

### Last-Minute Save Offers

- Offer last-minute discounts, free months, or other incentives to stay.
- Frame the offer as something “exclusive” only available because the user is valued.

### Forced Interaction

- Require manual chat with a retention agent.
- Force selection of detailed cancellation reasons before proceeding.

### Dead-End Loops

- Some flows subtly "error out" at the last step, forcing users to restart or contact support.
- Others hide the final "confirm" button under layers of links or minimized text.

## Why It Works

- **Cognitive Fatigue:** Every new page and question adds cognitive load. Users get tired.
- **Loss Aversion:** People feel pain more strongly than pleasure. Reminders of what they’ll "lose" amplify hesitation.
- **Anchoring:** Discount offers anchor users back to the perceived value they’re abandoning.
- **Inertia Bias:** The more effort a process demands, the more likely users are to abandon the attempt altogether.
